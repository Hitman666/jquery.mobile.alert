jQuery Mobile friendly Alert Dialog
by Brandon <antizeph@gmail.com>

6/27/2011 - bug fix

I made this quick and dirty script for a work project but I thought it could be useful to others.
I use it as success/error notifications with modal mode disabled, like "Successfully added to cart" or "Error blahing the blah".

Please tell me how badly this thing is made, I'll gladly commit anything that makes it better!


USAGE:
To call up an alert dialog:
	$.mobile.alert("your text", "title");
*note: the title is not currently being used, but I put it there to support one if needed*

Modal mode is on by default (dimming background).
To disable: $.mobile.modal = false; (in mobileinit bind for global setting; I'd like to have it be $.mobile.alert.modal instead.)
